#> - when are meter readings submitted?
#
#One round out of three the meter readings are submitted. This happens each Monday evening, before midnight.  The other votes are due on Wednesday before midnight and Friday before midnight. Does this answer your third question, too?
#
#> - how is speed calculated from meter readings?
#EC(n) = EnergyConsumption for week n for considered house
#MR(n) = MeterReading for week n
#ECmax(n) = Highest energy consumption among all houses on week n
#ECmin(n) = Lowest energy consumption among all houses on week n
#
#ECn = MR(n) - MR(n-1)
#
#Speed(n) = SpeedMin + ((EC(n) - ECmin(n))/(ECmax(n) - ECmin(n)))*(SpeedMax - SpeedMin)
